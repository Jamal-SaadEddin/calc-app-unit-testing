# JavaScript Calculator

## Overview
This project is part of an internship assignment at Foothill, focused on developing a JavaScript calculator with an emphasis on writing comprehensive unit tests. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and includes robust input validation.

## Features
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Validates input types and operators to ensure correct calculations.
- Handles edge cases like division by zero and numbers greater than 1000, which are ignored.
- Developed with test-driven development techniques to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Usage
To use the calculator, require the module in your JavaScript code and pass parameters as follows:
```javascript
{
  num1: <number>,
  operation1: <string>,
  num2: <number>,
  operation2: <string, optional>,
  num3: <number, optional>
}
```
The calculator executes the operations in sequence and returns the computed result.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started. Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the calculator.

## Testing
The project includes a `calculator.test.js` file, which demonstrates how to write unit tests for each function and scenario. It is a vital part of the internship's focus on learning test-driven development and achieving high code quality.
